Hi Abdul Rahman,

I would prefer maintenance office to confirm it as its our msia law n process as I understand. As far I as I know, the leaking your upstairs has nothing to do with my unit.

CC maintenance office, please reply the confirmation and cause of the leaking by Tuesday in this email for filling purposes. 

Well, u still can check anytime. WhatsApp me to arrange the timing

Thank you,

Hi Wayne;

The plumber for the unit above me will only come to my unit on 28 September since the owner is outstation. Only then everything can be confirmed. Anyway, the tiles for my toilet need to be replaced and water proofed first before any repair can be done to your unit or else the leak will not stop. When will you be free so that my plumber can check your unit?

It's quite clear it's from the pipe and Maintenance office already checked
Now No more leaking since nobody using it CC maintenance office, can you confirm this by tomorrow since you already checked.

Inform maintenance if leaking from the unit or from somewhere else.

Hi Wayne Poon;

I am in Cambodia till Sunday. I'll check with my plumber when he is available. My toilet also badly leaked from  the unit above me. There is a possibility that the leaks pass through the wall of my unit and go to your unit. I live alone and I have been in Cambodia since last Sunday. If your toilet still leaks now, then the possibility is there. Until the unit above me rectifies the problem,  then only your problem and my problem will be solved. Regards.

Hi Abd Rahman,

The cost of repair, painting and change of the ceiling for both toilet is rm1.5k from my contractor.

Are you OK with this value? 

May I know when are you going to get someone to fix the leaking ?

Regards,
Wayne

Hi Sir/Madam,

It's very unresponsive from the maintenance office and my tenant has been pushing me to terminate the contract due to this. 

>>May I know the rough estimation date of the fix? Can you please check with the tenant above?
You may have missed my inquiry

Also the question below. The cause of leaking and cost of the fix ? There was no response as usual.

Please reply by Thursday noon as per question above or else i have no choice to escalate to KPDN.

If the maintenance office can't reply as per the inquiry, I will suggest the maintenance office bare the fixing by this week. 

Thank you,
Wayne

Good day,

Since Monday I have connected with your tenant Azrita for updates of the complaint. Above unit, B3-07-08 does not use the master room toilet and he is waiting for his contractor's availability. 

MO already informed owner B3-07-08 to take fast action.
